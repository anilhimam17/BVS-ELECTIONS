# BVS-ELECTIONS

This is flask web application I have created for my school to address the issue of student council elections that are held in the school annually.
All the details regarding the libraries and dependencies are mentioned in the respective python files.

To start the webserver please be inside the project directory
-- ../BVS-ELECTIONS or ./BVS-ELECTIONS

And then execute the following terminal command
python3 application.py

The project should then start running on the local host.
